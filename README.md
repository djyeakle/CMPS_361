## Description:

My chatbot holds answers to trivia about me my roommate, and our cat. It is basic trivia such as our majors or our height.

## Technology Used:

I used PHP, JS, CSS, and HTML as well as PGAdmin4.

## Questions and Answers it knows:

"How tall is Delaney?"	--->  "Delaney is 5ft 10in" <br>
"How old is Alaina?"	--->  "Alaina is 20 years old." <br>
"What does Alaina major in?"	--->  "Alaina majors in Multimedia." <br>
"What does Delaney major in?"	--->  "Delaney majors in Computer Science." <br>
"Do Delaney and Alaina share a room?"	--->  "Delaney and Alaina do share a room." <br>
"What is the name of the 612 cat?"	--->  "The 612 cat is named Bagel." <br>
"What is kind of cat is Bagel"	--->  "Bagel is a Calico cat." <br>
"Is Bagel good or bad?"	--->  "It depends on the day." <br>
"Where is Delaney from?"	--->  "Rehoboth Beach is where Delaney is from." <br>
"Where is Alaina from?"	--->  "Carnegie is where Alaina is from." <br>

## Challenges:

When making the chatbot I realized it was just repeating my questions back to me which I solved by changing the bot reponse to botMessage instead of userInput.
I also made sure that the bot could recognize the questions even when not formatted properly which was done with the ILIKE property.
